# Hanger
A HTTP Client for Swift


## Getting Started
### Ubuntu

```sh
# Install build tools and libssl-dev
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install build-essential libtool libssl-dev
sudo apt-get install automake clang

# build and install libuv
git clone https://github.com/libuv/libuv.git && cd libuv
sh autogen.sh
./configure
make
make install
```

### Mac OS X

#### brew

```sh
brew install libuv
brew link libuv --force
```

And then, add
```swift
.Package(url: "https://github.com/slimane-swift/Hanger.git", majorVersion: 0, minor: 1)
```
in to your Package.swift


## Usage
```swift
import Hanger

let request = Request(method: .get, uri: URI(scheme: "http", host: "miketokyo.com"))

try! _ = Hanger(request: request) {
    let response = try! $0()
    print(response)
}

// Once need to run uv_loop
// But if you use Hanger in a Slimane/Skelton Project doesn't need here.
Loop.defaultLoop.run()
```

## Reusable Connection
You can reuse connection for the host to pass `ClientConnection` instance to the initializer.

Note: You need to manage connection life time on your own.
The `ClientConnection` should be released/closed with `close` method.

Here is an example.


```swift
import Hanger

// Make a request with Connection: Keep-Alive header
let request = Request(method: .get, uri: URI(scheme: "http", host: "miketokyo.com", headers: ["Connection": "Keep-Alive"]))

// Initialize a connection
let con = ClientConnection(host: request.uri.host!)

try! _ = Hanger(connection: con, request: request) {
    let response = try! $0()
    print(response)
}

try! _ = Hanger(connection: con, request: request) {
    let response = try! $0()
    print(response)
}

let t = Timer(tick: 1000)
t.start {
  t.end()
  con.close() // Close connection
}

Loop.defaultLoop.run()
```
